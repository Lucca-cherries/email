# Java Web Mail System
This is a web mail server system. The reason why I abandoned JavaMail, which is more convenient, is that this project was required to use socket programing.

## Quickstart
To use my toy system, you have to first configure SMTP and POP service correctly on some popular email server, such as QQ, Netease, Soho, and Sina etc. Then use my code to connect to servers through socket. Finally, you can receive and send emails freely on your owm. \COOL!/

## Other resources
I provided my course report in this repository. Besides, when I was doing this project, I referred to https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV18t411W7uo/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=d0c35bd945166518afac48af8599f9c1, which was instructive. I also highly recommend his book about mail development. My codebase was also based on https://github.com/BEACON13/internetCourseProject2020.git.
